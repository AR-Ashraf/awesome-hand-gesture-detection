<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Artificial Intelligence is paving it's way into world greatly. Using hand gestures to get the job done is an important feature that we can use to get the best out of AI. I found that there are scattered repos on this topic over the internet, I thought of making an app using this AI and publish it. So that people like you can learn all of from one place and can use that as an app anywhere they want.

If you are here because:
* You want to learn about using AI hand gestures to solve a problem
* You don't want to roam around sites to learn different parts of hand gestures AI.
* You love AI

Then you are at the right repo. Let's build something amazing then. If you get the time and love my repo then please consider giving it a star and follow :)

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

## Built With

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* [QT Designer](https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download)

You cannot run this program in Google Colab. Because we will use webcam in this project. To run it in Googel Colab your would have change the code of webcam video streaming part.
